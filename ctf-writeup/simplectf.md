* Simple CTF is just a beginner-level CTF on TryHackMe that showcases a few of the necessary skills needed for all CTF to include scanning and enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation.
  
* I start the machine and connected to my computer using OpenVpn.
* Then i started a basic port scanning using nmap in given ip of the machine and i got that 3 ports are open in this machine.
